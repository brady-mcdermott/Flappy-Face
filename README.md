# Flappy Face
Flappy Bird clone utilizing facial recognition to move the "bird"

</br>

## How it works
> Flappy Face uses Facial Recognition to detect your face's position in the camera and moves the "bird" to reflect that position. 
> 
> Move the bird by moving your head up and down to skate between the pipes.

## Collaboration Statement
This project was created in collaboration with Colin May (github.com/ColinMay) for a high school computer science final project in 2019.

</br>

## Scheduled Updates
Going to be refactoring this project intermittently. </br>
### In the works
1. Improve collision detection
2. Update movement to better reflect the Flappy Bird original
    * Planning on switching to detect when the user smiles, making the player object "flap"
    * When this update is implemented, planning on changing name to Happy Bird ;)
